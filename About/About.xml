  <description>Job Splitter

Yet another mod that splits up jobs into smaller jobs for the sake of micromanaging everything. 
With this mod you can manage your colony in ways that you can't normally do in vanilla, like setting your best doctor to be the only one who performs surgery, or assigning a pawn to become a dedicated stonecutter or smelter without them doing the other. 
This mod really adds a ton of different roles that colonists can fill.</description>
